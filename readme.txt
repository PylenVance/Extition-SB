Hello, This is a small discord.js v13 selfbot base made by Lesik.

This features 2 commands listed below to test it out.
{
    1. ping
    2. 8ball
}

How to get token:
    1. open discord.com
    2. press control + shift + i
    3. On top right press the ">>"
    4. Click application
    5. Open local storage and click the "discord.com" storage
    6. scroll to the bottom and refresh the site.
    7. when refreshing the token will popup for a short period of time at the bottom of storage list so be quick to copy it
    8. You now have your token ready to be pasted/used in Config.json

How to run:

    1. Run install.bat (This will install the Selfbot NPM package)
    2. Insert token into the configuration file (Config.json)
    3. Run Launch.bat (if done correctly it should say welcome + discord username)

Note:
    This is all done single-filed so everything will be in base.js
